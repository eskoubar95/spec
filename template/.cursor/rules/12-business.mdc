# Business Analysis Foundations

## Purpose

Business analysis patterns for requirements gathering, user stories, business logic, and domain models. These patterns apply to business-focused tasks and requirements definition.

## Principles

- **User-Centric**: Focus on user value and outcomes
- **Clear Requirements**: Explicit, testable requirements
- **Domain-Driven**: Business logic reflects domain understanding
- **Value-Focused**: Prioritize features by business value

## Requirements Gathering

**Ask the Right Questions:**
- What problem are we solving?
- Who is the user?
- What value does this deliver?
- What does success look like?
- What are the constraints?

**Document Requirements:**
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Business rules and logic
- Success metrics
- Constraints and limitations

## User Stories

**Format:**
- As a [user type]
- I want [goal]
- So that [benefit]

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [outcome]

**Example:**
```
As a customer
I want to save items to my wishlist
So that I can purchase them later

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given I am logged in
- When I click "Save to Wishlist" on a product
- Then the product is added to my wishlist
- And I can view my wishlist later
- And I can remove items from my wishlist
```

## Business Logic

**Domain Models:**
- Represent business entities
- Contain business rules
- Are framework-agnostic
- Reflect real-world concepts

**Business Rules:**
- Explicit rules, not implicit
- Documented in spec or code
- Testable and verifiable
- Can be changed as business evolves

**Value Proposition:**
- Clear value to users
- Measurable outcomes
- Business impact
- Success metrics

## Domain-Driven Design

**Domain Models:**
- Entities: Things with identity (User, Order, Product)
- Value Objects: Things without identity (Money, Address)
- Aggregates: Clusters of entities (Order with OrderItems)
- Services: Operations that don't fit entities

**Business Logic Location:**
- Domain models contain business rules
- Services orchestrate business operations
- Repositories handle data access
- Keep business logic out of UI/API layers

## Success Metrics

**Define Measurable Outcomes:**
- User engagement metrics
- Business value metrics
- Performance metrics
- Quality metrics

**Track Progress:**
- Baseline measurements
- Target goals
- Current status
- Improvement over time

## Requirements Traceability

**Link Requirements to Implementation:**
- Requirements → Spec → Plan → Tasks → Code
- Track which code implements which requirement
- Verify requirements are met
- Update requirements as needed

## Business Rules Documentation

**Document Business Rules:**
- In spec files (spec/05-decisions.md)
- In code comments (for complex logic)
- In domain model documentation
- Keep rules explicit and testable
