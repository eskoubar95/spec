# Spec-Driven Development – Project Operating System (POS)

This repository provides a **Project Operating System (POS)** for building software projects using **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** inside Cursor.

It is designed to help you:
- Work at an *engineer-level* without overengineering
- Avoid vibe-coding and premature implementation
- Turn ideas into clear, executable plans
- Maintain alignment between intent, execution, and validation

This workspace separates **process** from **project content**.
You define the process once, then reuse it for every new project.

## Core philosophy

### Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

In SDD, **the specification is the source of truth**.

- Specs define *intent*
- Plans derive from specs
- Tasks implement specs
- Validation confirms specs were met

Code never silently diverges from the spec.
If something changes, the spec changes first.

### Project Operating System (POS)

The POS enforces:
- Clear phases of work
- Explicit transitions between phases
- Scope control and traceability
- Quality gates before integration

The goal is not bureaucracy — it is **clarity, correctness, and confidence**.

## Repository structure

```txt
.cursor/
  rules/        # Always-on behavioral rules (the operating system)
  commands/     # Explicit workflow commands (the interface)

spec/           # Source of truth (generated dynamically)
work/           # Execution artifacts (generated dynamically)

README.md       # This file
```

### Important
Only **rules and commands** are pre-defined.
All specs, plans, tasks, and logs are created dynamically through usage.

---

## CLI Tool

This repository includes a CLI tool to bootstrap new SDD projects.

### Local Development

To build and run the CLI locally:

```bash
cd cli
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js init
```

### Usage

Once published to npm, the CLI will be available via:

```bash
npx @eskoubar95/spec init
```

Or directly from GitHub (before npm publish):

```bash
npx github:eskoubar95/spec init
```

The `spec init` command will:
- Prompt for project name (folder name)
- Ask for task mode: `local` (default) or `linear`
- Optionally initialize a git repository
- Copy the POS template into a new project folder
- Create Linear sync configuration if mode is `linear`

After initialization, open the project in Cursor and run `/spec/init` to begin defining your project specification.

## The rules (the operating system)

Located in `.cursor/rules/`.

### `00-pos.mdc`
Defines the overall Project Operating System:
- Work phases and modes
- Scope control
- Quality expectations
- Agent behavior

### `01-sdd.mdc`
Defines Spec-Driven Development:
- How specs evolve
- How intent flows through the project
- How change is handled

### `02-work-mode.mdc`
Defines execution discipline:
- How tasks are started
- How scope is controlled
- How validation is enforced

These rules are **always applied** and should rarely change.

---

## The commands (how you work)

Commands are the **only way** you should interact with the system.
They define explicit transitions between phases.

### Spec commands

#### `/spec/init`
Start a new project.

- Pitch the idea freely
- Generates the initial root specification
- Captures risks and open questions

Creates/updates:
- `spec/00-root-spec.md`
- `spec/03-risks.md`
- `spec/04-open-questions.md`

---

#### `/spec/refine`
Improve clarity without planning or implementation.

Use when:
- The idea is still fuzzy
- Scope feels unclear
- Assumptions need to be surfaced

May update:
- Root spec
- Risks
- Open questions
- Decisions (only if explicitly made)

---

#### `/spec/plan`
Turn a clear spec into an executable plan.

- Creates milestones and tasks
- Adds acceptance criteria
- Updates risks discovered during planning

Creates/updates:
- `work/backlog/milestones.md`
- `work/backlog/tasks.local.md`
- `spec/01-prd.md` (if needed)
- `spec/06-acceptance.md` (if needed)

---

### Task commands

#### `/task/start`
Begin work on a single task.

- Selects one task
- Locks scope
- Defines acceptance signals
- Prepares safe execution

No code is written yet.

---

#### `/task/validate`
Validate completed work before commit or PR.

- Confirms correctness
- Checks scope and spec alignment
- Requires evidence (tests or verification)

Produces a clear outcome:
- Approved
- Requires fixes
- Requires spec refinement

---

## Typical workflow

```txt
/spec/init
/spec/refine   (optional, repeatable)
/spec/plan
/task/start
[work]
/task/validate
```

This loop is repeated for each task.

---

## What NOT to do

- Do not manually create specs or tasks
- Do not add placeholders or TODOs
- Do not plan before understanding
- Do not implement without acceptance criteria
- Do not let code diverge silently from the spec

The system exists to prevent these failures.

---

## When to change the system

Only adjust:
- Rules when behavior is consistently wrong
- Commands when workflow transitions feel unclear

Do **not** tune the system for a single project.

---

## Who this is for

This workspace is ideal if you:
- Want to work like a professional engineer
- Use Cursor with AI agents
- Build complex projects incrementally
- Care about correctness and clarity

You do **not** need a formal engineering background.

---

## Final note

If something feels hard to reason about:
- Stop
- Refine the spec
- Let clarity lead execution

That is Spec-Driven Development.
