# Design Foundations

## Purpose

Framework-agnostic design system patterns, UI components, and visual consistency guidelines. These patterns apply to all design tasks regardless of styling framework.

## Design System Reference

**Always reference project design system if it exists:**
- Check for `spec/07-design-system.md`
- Follow established color, typography, spacing systems
- Maintain visual consistency with existing design

## Principles

- **Consistency**: Visual consistency across all UI
- **Accessibility First**: WCAG AA minimum, aim for AAA
- **Responsive by Default**: Mobile-first approach
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Guide user attention effectively

## Component Design

**Reusable, Composable UI Components:**
- Build components from primitives
- Components are self-contained
- Components are composable
- Components follow design system tokens

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- Semantic HTML elements
- Correct ARIA roles and labels
- Visible focus states
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader support
- Color contrast (WCAG AA minimum)

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints: mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), desktop (1024px+)
- Fluid typography and spacing
- Flexible layouts (flexbox, grid)

## Visual Consistency

**Color System:**
- Use design system color tokens
- Semantic colors (success, error, warning, info)
- Consistent color usage across components

**Typography:**
- Use design system typography scale
- Consistent font families, weights, sizes
- Proper line heights and spacing

**Spacing:**
- Use design system spacing scale
- Consistent margins and padding
- Visual rhythm and alignment

## UI Patterns

**Card Layouts:**
- Consistent card styling
- Proper spacing and shadows
- Responsive card grids

**Button Styles:**
- Primary, secondary, outline variants
- Consistent sizing and spacing
- Proper disabled states
- Loading states

**Form Inputs:**
- Consistent input styling
- Proper labels and placeholders
- Error states and validation feedback
- Accessible form controls

**Navigation Patterns:**
- Consistent navigation structure
- Clear active states
- Mobile-friendly navigation
- Breadcrumbs where appropriate

## Framework-Specific Extensions

This rule provides foundation patterns. For framework-specific patterns, see:
- Tailwind CSS: `[tailwind]-*.mdc` (if Tailwind detected)
- CSS Modules: `[css-modules]-*.mdc` (if CSS Modules detected)
- Styled Components: `[styled-components]-*.mdc` (if detected)
- Other styling: `[styling]-*.mdc` (if detected)
