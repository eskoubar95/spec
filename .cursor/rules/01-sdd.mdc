# Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

This project follows Spec-Driven Development.
Specifications are living artifacts that drive planning, execution, and validation.

## Core SDD rules
- The specification defines intent; code implements intent.
- Specs evolve continuously throughout the project lifecycle.
- No work may proceed on assumptions that are not reflected in the spec.

## Spec lifecycle
SDD operates through explicit transitions:
- Idea → Specification (`/spec/init`)
- Specification → Clarity (`/spec/refine`)
- Specification → Plan (`/spec/plan`)
- Plan → Execution (`/task/start`)
- Execution → Confidence (`/task/validate`)

Each transition must leave the specification more precise than before.

## What the spec must capture
The spec must always make explicit:
- What problem is being solved
- Who it is for
- What is in scope and out of scope
- What success means

If any of these are unclear, they must be surfaced as open questions.

## Handling change
Change is expected.
When change occurs:
- Update the spec before updating code
- Re-evaluate risks and assumptions
- Ensure tasks remain traceable to spec intent

Never allow the spec and implementation to diverge silently.

## Decisions
- Decisions are explicit moments of commitment
- Only record real decisions (not ideas or suggestions)
- Decisions must explain: what was decided, why, and consequences

## Anti-patterns (strictly avoid)
- Writing code to discover requirements
- Planning before understanding
- Expanding scope during task execution
- Treating specs as documentation-only artifacts

## Agent responsibility
- Treat the spec as the authoritative truth
- Prefer updating the spec over guessing
- Stop and ask when intent is ambiguous
- Keep specs concise, readable, and actionable

## Goal
Enable disciplined, professional development by making intent explicit before implementation.
