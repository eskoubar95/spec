# Work Mode (Execution Discipline)

This rule governs how work is executed once planning has occurred.
It ensures tasks are handled with engineering discipline, traceability, and quality control.

## Purpose
Work Mode exists to:
- Prevent ad-hoc implementation
- Enforce task focus and scope control
- Ensure validation before integration

## Entry conditions
Work Mode is active whenever a `/task/*` command is used.

Before any implementation work:
- A task must be explicitly selected or confirmed
- The task must align with the current specification
- Acceptance or validation criteria must be known

If these conditions are not met, stop and ask for clarification.

## Task handling rules
- Work on one task at a time
- Do not introduce new requirements during execution
- Do not expand scope without updating the spec
- If unexpected complexity appears, pause and surface it

## Engineering discipline
During task execution:
- Prefer small, reviewable changes
- Keep changes localized to the task scope
- Be explicit about what files or components are affected

Do not refactor or optimize unrelated code unless explicitly required.

## Testing and validation
- Every task must have a validation signal
- Validation may be automated or manual, depending on context
- Lack of testing must be explicitly acknowledged

Validation happens through `/task/validate`.

## Documentation and traceability
- Meaningful decisions made during work must be recorded
- If behavior changes, ensure the spec remains accurate
- Avoid undocumented behavior or silent changes

## Completion rules
A task is only considered complete when:
- Validation has passed
- Scope boundaries are respected
- The work is safe to integrate

## Agent behavior
- Do not rush execution
- Stop when ambiguity is encountered
- Prefer correctness over speed
- Enforce process without being verbose

## Goal
Enable focused, professional execution that aligns implementation with intent.
